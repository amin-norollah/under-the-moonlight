# Under The Moon light

This project is a work of art. Have you ever been bored and looking for something to cheer you up? This is the same project that I developed with love and pleasure. The images in this project were all designed from scratch and then converted to SVG format with the help of corelDraw tool. This was just the beginning and I separated the SVG codes and put them in my HTML files. I changed their styles and classes and make them dynamically based on events and, in summary, I tried to develop a magnificent work of art.

This project is developed using Angular framework. I would be happy to know your opinion about this project.
